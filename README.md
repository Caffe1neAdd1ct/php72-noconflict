# php72-noconflict

Suffixed installed PHP 7.2 for arch linux

## Install

  git clone https://github.com/Caffe1neAdd1ct/php72-noconflict.git
  cd php72-noconflict
  makepkg -sri

## Why?

There are suffixed installs for php56, php70 and php71. Arch linux recently moved up to php73 for the core stable package and no php72 package is available yet.

Use this at your own risk, no warranty or fitness for purpose to be found here.

## Deprecated

Use AUR https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/php72/

Has been updated with no-conflict style install away from mainline php
